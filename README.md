AggQN
=====

Overview
--------

AggQN (Aggregated quasi-Newton) contains implementations of classes for storing and employing quasi-Newton (inverse) Hessian approximations for use in an optimization algorithm.

An AggQN object is currently available in Matlab.  (An implementation in C++ is forthcoming.)  The code is released under the MIT License.  The main authors are [Albert Berahas](https://sites.google.com/view/asberahas), [Frank E. Curtis](http://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/frankecurtis/), and [Baoyu Zhou](http://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/baz216/).  For a list of all contributors, please see the [AUTHORS file](AggQN/AUTHORS).
